# I scraped my site!

## woot!

This is something I've been working on for a bit. I have been running through tutorials trying to figure
out how to crawl a website and take it's links. The next thing I have to do now is run those links
through another scraper.

Not my code, all code belongs to [DataBlogger]()https://www.data-blogger.com/2016/08/18/scraping-a-website-with-python-scrapy/
